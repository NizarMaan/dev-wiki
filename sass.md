### Open Terminal

On the Mac the Terminal.app comes installed by default. It's located in your "Utilities" folder. On Windows, run `cmd`.

### Install Sass

Ruby uses Gems to manage its various packages of code like Sass. In your open terminal window type:

```
gem install sass
```

This will install Sass and any dependencies for you. It's pretty magical. If you get an error message then it's likely you will need to use the sudo command to install the Sass gem. It would look like:

```
sudo gem install sass
```

### Double-Check

You should now have Sass installed, but it never hurts to double-check. In your terminal application you can type:

```
sass -v
```
